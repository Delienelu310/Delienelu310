## Hi, I`m Pavlo Seredokha

I`ve been enjoying programming since high school as a way to express my creativity and satisfy my need for problem solving

Recently I`ve been working a lot developing architecture for distributed data processing driven by Apache Spark and I really liked it.
Therefore, I am looking forward to Backend role in Java and I would like to work in a friendly team on a project with architecture full of diverse services: redis, kafka, rabbitmq, s3 buckets - i like technologies aimed at optimization like these
